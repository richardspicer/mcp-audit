# ⚠️ mcp-audit has moved

**This repository has been deprecated.** mcp-audit is now part of [counteragent](https://github.com/richardspicer/counteragent), a unified AI agent red team platform.

## Migration

See the [counteragent README](https://github.com/richardspicer/counteragent#readme) for installation instructions.

The CLI command is now:

```bash
counteragent audit scan --transport stdio --command "your-server-command"
counteragent audit list-checks
