feat: add prompt injection scanner (MCP06) with fixture and tests

- PromptInjectionScanner with 5 checks: injection patterns in responses
  (MCP06-001), hidden Unicode in responses (MCP06-002), suspicious URLs
  (MCP06-003), cross-tool manipulation references (MCP06-004), anomalous
  response length (MCP06-005)
- Active scanner: calls tools with safe args, analyzes response content
- Reuses injection pattern and hidden Unicode detection from tool_poisoning
- Suspicious URL detection (IP addresses, known exfil patterns, data URIs)
- Cross-tool reference detection (responses mentioning other tools by name)
- vuln_prompt_inject.py fixture with poisoned responses and clean tools
- 23 new tests (95 total passing)
- Registered in scanner registry
