feat: add audit telemetry scanner (MCP08) with fixture and tests

- AuditTelemetryScanner with 5 checks: missing server identification
  (MCP08-001), error information disclosure (MCP08-002), no logging
  capability (MCP08-003), sensitive data in errors (MCP08-004),

- Hybrid scanner: static metadata checks + active error triggering
- Error disclosure detection (tracebacks, file paths, SQL, package paths)
- Sensitive data detection (tokens, emails, IPs, keys, connection strings)
- vuln_audit_telemetry.py fixture with verbose errors and no logging
- 22 new tests (117 total passing)
