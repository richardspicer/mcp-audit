feat: add permissions scanner (MCP02) with fixture and tests

- PermissionsScanner with 4 checks: excessive tool count, dangerous
  capability classification, unconstrained parameter detection,
  write/execute ratio analysis
- Static analysis only — no tool invocation, works from enumerated metadata
- 5 danger categories: shell exec, file write, database, network, credential
- Regex-based parameter constraint checking for paths, URLs, commands, queries
- vuln_permissions.py fixture: 17 overprivileged tools modeling scope creep
- 17 new tests (50 total passing): integration, edge cases, helper units
- Registered in scanner registry
